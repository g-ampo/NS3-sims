# Cross-layer routing

This subdirectory contains the code, config files etc to implement the ETX metric for the various protocols, starting with AODV.

The cross-layer AODV project works with NS release 3.28.

For Cross-layer AODV you need to install NS 3.28 just as we did with NS 3.35 in the base directory of this github repository.
